Track decision instructions
===========================

You can find all talks submitted for your track and their reviews in the "Submission status_<your track>" spreadsheet that we will share with you ahead of the track decision deadline. The spreadsheet includes some helpful tools to see the average scores for your track’s submissions, set the status and add comments. Feel free to edit the spreadsheet as needed. Once you have made your decisions, please submit your assignments via Pretalx using the instructions below.

Here are the steps to follow in Pretalx to make your selections:

1. Go to the “Reviews” tab.
2. Select “Talk” under “Session type”. Select your track under “Tracks” and click “Search”.
3. Click the “Accept” check mark on the row(s) for each proposal you’d like to accept as a Talk. Click “Reject” only if you believe the submission is incompatible with or does not meet the quality bar for the conference.
4. For submissions that you want to offer an in-person or virtual Poster slot, please click on the proposal title, change the Session type to “Poster” or “Virtual poster” and click “Save”.
5. For submissions that you want to mark as a back-up Talk, please add a note to the proposal’s “Internal notes” with priority number (e.g. “Back-up talk 1” or “Back-up talk 2”).
6. **Important**: Make sure the “Mark new states as ‘pending’” checkbox is selected.
7. Click on “Go.”
8. Repeat the above steps 2-5 for all submissions, but with Session type “Poster”.
9. For all submissions you’ve labeled as “Virtual Poster”, please leave the status as “Submitted”.
