Track decision instructions
===========================

You can find all talks submitted for your track and their reviews in the "Submission status_<your track>" spreadsheet that we will share with you ahead of the track decision deadline. The spreadsheet includes some helpful tools to see the average scores for your track’s submissions, set the status and add comments. Feel free to edit the spreadsheet as needed. Once you have made your decisions, please submit your assignments via Pretalx using the instructions below.

Here are the steps to follow in Pretalx to make your selections:

1. Go to the “Reviews” tab.
2. Select “Talk” under “Session type”. Select your track under “Tracks” and click “Search”.
3. Click the “Accept” check mark on the row(s) for each proposal you’d like to accept as a Talk. Click “Reject” only if you believe the submission is incompatible with or does not meet the quality bar for the conference.
 - For submissions that were submitted as "Talk" type but you want to offer a Poster slot, please click on the proposal title, change the Session type to “Poster” and click “Save”.
